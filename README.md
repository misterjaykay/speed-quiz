## Overview (Contents)

This is Homework 4 - Speed Quiz (Timed Quiz).

In this activity, I created a app that generates quiz with choices, and a user needs to pick an correct answer 
within the set period of time.

There is an timer set to 60 seconds, when you click a button to play, timer will start and If you pick a wrong answer, you'll lose five second to your timer. 

Also, If you get the answer right you will get a point, but if you pick a wrong answer you will lose a point.

This quiz game will be over in two condition: when you finish the quiz or when the timer reaches 0.

When the quiz is over, you will see a result screen with your score, and you will be able to save your score along with your name onscoreboard.
